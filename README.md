# My answers | Advent of Code 2022

I'll be posting here my [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) answers as I first wrote them the first time.

> :warning: NOT CLEAN CODE & NOT EFICENT CODE. My goal is to code as fast as possible.

Run instructions:

```zsh
nvm install node
npm install

# Replace <day> and <part> with numbers
npx ts-node-dev --respawn ./src/challenges/<day>/<part>/index.ts

# Example
npx ts-node-dev --respawn ./src/challenges/1/1/index.ts
```
